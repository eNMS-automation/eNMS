        Multiprocessing allows work for multiple devices to run concurrently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the checkbox to enable/disable multiprocessing for a service or workflow.
        The Maximum Number of Processes field controls the limit of how many devices can run concurrently.
        Higher concurrency makes sense for operations that spend a lot of time waiting for data from devices,
        lower concurrency for compute focused activities.
        Actual performance varies based on other activities running on the same system.
