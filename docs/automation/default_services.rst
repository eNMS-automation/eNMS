Ansible Playbook Service
-------------------------------------------------

An ``Ansible Playbook`` service sends an ansible playbook to the devices.
The output can be validated with a command / pattern mechanism, like the ``Netmiko Validation Service``.

Configuration parameters for creating this service instance:

- ``Playbook Path`` path and filename to the Ansible Playbook. The location for displaying playbooks is configurable in
  eNMS settings.
- ``Arguments`` ansible-playbook command line options, which are documented here: (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html)
- ``Pass device properties to the playbook`` Pass inventory properties using --extra-vars to the playbook if checked
  (along with the options dictionary provided below). All device properties are passed such as ``device.name`` or ``device.ip_address``
- ``options`` Additional --extra-vars to be passed to the playbook using the syntax {'key1':value1, 'key2': value2}.
  All inventory properties are automatically passed to the playbook using --extra-vars (if pass_device_properties is
  selected above). These options are appended.
- Ansible itself supports a number of standard return codes; these are returned in the results of the service and include:

  - 0 : OK or no hosts matched
  - 1 : Error
  - 2 : One or more hosts failed
  - 3 : One or more hosts were unreachable
  - 4 : Parser error
  - 5 : Bad or incomplete options
  - 99 : User interrupted execution
  - 250 : Unexpected error

.. note:: This Service supports variable substitution (as mentioned in the previous section) in the `arguments` and
   `options` input fields of its configuration form.


Netmiko Services
--------------------------------------------------

The Netmiko services provide the ability to perform multiple actions through an SSH connection. Below are the values
common to each Netmiko service and the specifics for each are in their own sections.

Common Netmiko Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``Driver`` This selects which Netmiko driver to use when connecting to the device. This is not used if ``Use Device Driver``
  is checked.
- ``Use Device Driver`` If checked, the driver assigned to the device in the inventory will be used.
- ``Enable mode`` If checked, Netmiko should enter enable\priviledged mode on the device before applying the above
  configuration block. For the Linux driver, this means root/sudo.
- ``Config mode`` If checked, Netmiko should enter config mode
- ``Fast CLI`` If checked, Netmiko will disable internal wait states and delays in order to execute the service as fast as possible.
- ``Timeout`` Netmiko internal timeout in seconds to wait for a connection or response before declaring failure.
- ``Delay factor`` Netmiko multiplier used to increase internal delays (defaults to 1). Delay factor is used in the
  send_command Netmiko method. See here for more explanation: (https://pynet.twb-tech.com/blog/automation/netmiko-what-is-done.html)
- ``Global delay factor`` Netmiko multiplier used to increase internal delays (defaults to 1). Global delay factor affects
  more delays beyond Netmiko send_command. Increase this for devices that have trouble buffering and responding quickly.

.. note:: ``Expect String`` and ``Auto Find Prompt`` are mutually exclusive; both cannot be enabled at the same time.
   If the user does not expect Netmiko to find the prompt automatically, the user should provide the expected prompt instead.

- ``Command to Enter Config Mode`` The default command used to enter config mode is determined by the Netmiko driver.
  An alternate configuration mode entry command can be specified here to overrride the default.  Examples are the Juniper
  ``config private`` and ``config exclusive`` commands that isolate configuration changes from other users.
- ``Strip command`` Remove the echo of the command from the output (default: True).
- ``Strip prompt`` Remove the trailing router prompt from the output (default: True).
