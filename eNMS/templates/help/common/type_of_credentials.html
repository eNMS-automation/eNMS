    <b>Type of Credentials</b> allows you to select the type of device credentials to use for
    a connection which can be <b>Any</b>, <b>Read Write</b> or <b>Read Only</b>.
    This selection does not override Role Based Access rules. However, if for a given device,
    a user has access to multiple credentials of type <b>Read Write</b> and <b>Read Only</b>,
    this option allows the service author to specify which type of credential to use for the
    connection.
