    <h2>Command to Enter Config Mode</h2>
    <p>
      Advanced users might want to specify options on the command for entering config
      mode. This is useful on some devices to ensure that no other users are making
      concurrent configuration changes or to isolate their changes from other users.
    </p>
    <p>
      When no command is specified, the default command from the Netmiko driver is used.

    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <h2>Juniper and Arista</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Juniper and Arista both support <b>config exclusive</b> to enter config mode
        only if no other users are already in config, and to prevent other users from
        entering config mode until the current configuration session completes. They
        also support <b>config private</b> to ensure that changes committed in the
        current session include only commands entered in the session.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default config entry command allows other concurrent changes, and a commit,
        in any session, commits config changes from all sessions.
